**Choosed Dataset from Kaggle** : [https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)

## Tried both ssdlite\_mobilenet\_v2\_coco and faster\_rcnn\_inception\_v2\_coco

- I have trained bothe the nodels with **150k steps** and have acheived good accuracy in Faster RCNN when compared to SSDlite.
- But the Frames per second is very good in SSD(10+ FPS) than in RCNN(0.7 FPS).
